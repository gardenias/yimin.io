## Preparation

- link:/post/tech/openhft-chronicle-map/[OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map]

## Key points

- Enterprise Edition feature
- It's TCP/IP Replication
- **TCP/IP Throttling** - only broadcasts the latest update of each entry

## How Chronicle Map Replication works

1. Refer to an instance of a remote map as a node. Each node [red]`can be connected to up to 128 other nodes.`
1. each remote map mirrors its changes over to another remote map.
1. Neither map is considered to be the master store of data.
1. Each map [red]`uses timestamps to reconcile changes`, When the timestamps are the same, the remote node with the smaller identifier will be preferred.

## Multiple Processes on the same server with Replication

- **exchange data via shared memory** - rather than by TCP or UDP replication.
- **Only one instance is set up TCP or UDP replicated** - if the TCP replicated Chronicle Map instance received an update from a remote node, then this update would be immediately available to all the instances of Chronicle Map on the server

## Identifier for Replication

- **must have their identifiers set** - if you wish to replicate data between two or more server. otherwise all of the Chronicle Map instances not actively participating in TCP or UDP replication.
- **identifier must be unique to each server** - 
** Each ChronicleMap on the same server must have the same identifier.
** Chronicle Map replication ignores updates which have originated from itself.

## Replication event logging

- can be configured to log all replication events to a Chronicle Queue for auditing purposes.
- Currently, a map can be configured to log all outgoing events that it sends to remote peers.
