[quote, Writer Herbert Steinhouse, who interviewed him in 1948]
____________________________________________________________________
Schindler's exceptional deeds stemmed from just that elementary sense of decency and humanity that our sophisticated age seldom sincerely believes in. A repentant opportunist saw the light and rebelled against the sadism and vile criminality all around him.


辛德勒的卓越事迹只是源自于基本的礼仪和人性，只不过我们长大后就极少再真诚地相信这些礼仪和人性了。他是一个看到曙光而悔改的机会主义者，并从此背弃了周围的虐待狂和卑鄙的罪犯。

I felt that the Jews were being destroyed. I had to help them; there was no choice.

我觉得犹太民族正在遭到毁灭。我对此别无选择，必须帮助他们。
